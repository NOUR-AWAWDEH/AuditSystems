# Entity Base Implementation Notes

## Base Entity Structure
All entities in the system should inherit from the base entity class which includes:
- ID (UNIQUEIDENTIFIER)
- CreatedDate (DATETIME)
- UpdatedDate (DATETIME)

## Important Guidelines

### 1. Entity Creation
- Always use GUID (UNIQUEIDENTIFIER) as primary keys
- Set CreatedDate automatically using DEFAULT GETDATE()
- UpdatedDate should be NULL when first created
- Use proper naming conventions for all entities

### 2. Relationships
- Use proper foreign key constraints
- Maintain referential integrity
- Consider cascade delete implications
- Use appropriate relationship types (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)

### 3. Data Validation
- Implement required field validations
- Use appropriate data types and lengths
- Add unique constraints where necessary
- Consider business rules validation

### 4. Audit Trail
- CreatedDate is automatically set
- UpdatedDate should be updated when entity is modified
- Consider tracking who created/modified the entity
- Maintain history of changes if required

### 5. Performance Considerations
- Create appropriate indexes
- Consider query optimization
- Be mindful of relationship depth
- Use lazy loading where appropriate

### 6. Security
- Implement proper access control
- Consider data encryption needs
- Handle sensitive data appropriately
- Follow security best practices

### 7. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't use hard deletes (use soft delete pattern)
- Avoid circular references
- Don't skip base entity properties
- Don't modify CreatedDate after initial creation

### 8. Best Practices
- Follow DDD principles
- Use meaningful names
- Keep entities focused and cohesive
- Implement proper validation

### 9. Code Example
```csharp
public abstract class BaseEntity
{
    public Guid ID { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? UpdatedDate { get; set; }
}

public class YourEntity : BaseEntity
{
    // Entity specific properties
}
